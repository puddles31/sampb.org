My Website

What do I want to display on the website?
- About me
- Any coding projects I have done (e.g. Unity/GameMaker, Java things, etc. QUACKZILLA)
- Photos from walks (Fife Coastal Path, Hill walking)
- Some contact details (Website email address, GitHub, etc.)
- Cooking - Show some recipes I use with pictures! Maybe make a recipe chooser idk
- "Blog" posts? Maybe like an update page (e.g. "Fife Coastal Path - St Andrews to Newport" and have text + photos for it)


Website Structure:
- Home page: Show about me, most recent blog post, contact details
- Coding page: Show details about previous coding projects
- Photography page: Show photos from walks (do I want to show all photos at once, or group them? e.g. "Schiehallion Day Trip" group)
- Cooking page: Show recipe details that I use
- Blog page: Show blog posts that I add - text, date, images, etc.
Navbar connects all pages together with links

Adding Content:
- Create a program to convert simple text/markdown into a HTML page of the correct layout
- For example, to add a new blog post I would first write the post contents in a markdown file:

	## Title
	# Header
	Paragraph
	@ Link
	% Image
	etc...

- Then I would run the program from the command line, passing in the file path and layout type:
	java HTMLGenerator new-blog-post.md blog
	java HTMLGenerator new-photos.md photography
- This will create a new text file that contains the HTML code to insert into the website on GitHub
